# Deploying NeonTube

The app is **cross-platform** in two senses already:

1. **Browser** — works on any modern desktop or mobile browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
2. **Server runtime** — the `/api/info` and `/api/download` routes are written against the Web `fetch` standard, so they run on Cloudflare Workers, Netlify Functions, Vercel Edge, Node servers, and Deno without code changes.

---

## Easiest: publish on Lovable (Cloudflare) — one click

Click **Publish** in the top-right of the editor. Server routes deploy automatically. Nothing to configure.

---

## Netlify

A `netlify.toml` is already in the repo. It tells Netlify to:
- Run `npm run build`
- Publish `dist/client` as the static asset folder
- Switch the Nitro server build to the `netlify` preset (Netlify Functions)
- Route every request through the generated server function so `/api/*` works

### Steps

1. Push this project to GitHub (or connect your Lovable repo directly to Netlify).
2. On Netlify: **Add new site → Import from Git → pick this repo**.
3. Leave the build settings empty — `netlify.toml` provides everything.
4. Click **Deploy**.

### If your previous Netlify deploy errored

The previous failure was almost certainly one of these:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Function bundle failed` / `worker not supported` | Build was targeting Cloudflare (`workerd`), Netlify can't run that bundle | `NITRO_PRESET=netlify` in `netlify.toml` ✅ already set |
| `Page not found` on every route except `/` | Missing SPA/SSR redirect | The catch-all redirect is in `netlify.toml` ✅ |
| `Module not found` during build | Wrong Node version | `NODE_VERSION=20` in `netlify.toml` ✅ |
| `404` on `/api/info` after deploy | API routes weren't wired to the server function | The redirect routes `/*` to the function ✅ |

If it still fails, copy the **last 30 lines of the Netlify build log** into the chat and I'll patch it.

## Vercel

Add a `vercel.json` or just set the env var in the Vercel dashboard:

```
NITRO_PRESET = vercel
```

No other config needed — Vercel auto-detects the build.

---

## Self-host on a Node server (VPS, Docker, Render, Railway, Fly.io)

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=node-server npm run build
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

Listens on `PORT` (default 3000).

## Why downloads work without your own backend

`/api/download` calls a public conversion provider server-side and returns a signed CDN URL. The browser then triggers a normal `<a download>` click, so the file lands in the user's Downloads folder with the real video title — same behavior on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
